# Minimalistic DS2:SOTFS (or whatever if you change folder names) save backup manager (yet another one)

It can create backups. Restore it. List it. Nothing else.

## Installation

1. Load code
2. Build it `dotnet publish -p:PublishSingleFile=true`
3. place result somewhere in `$PATH`
4. Use it

## Usage

`ds2backup` without parameters will list all what it can. Or, you just can read code (it's short as gherkin)
